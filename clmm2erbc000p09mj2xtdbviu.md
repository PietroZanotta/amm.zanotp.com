## Introduction

In an age where technology blurs the line between reality and illusion, StarConnect emerges as a groundbreaking solution addressing the rising deep fake problem through the innovative integration of blockchain and NFT technology. StarConnect is a cutting-edge platform that facilitates the creation of personalized content by connecting creators and fans through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This concept not only empowers content creators to monetize their skills but also safeguards the authenticity of the content exchanged between creators and their fans.

Deep fake technology, which can manipulate audio and video to create realistic but entirely fabricated content, poses a significant threat to trust and authenticity in the digital world. StarConnect takes a proactive approach to this issue by allowing creators to authenticate their content through the blockchain, ensuring that fans receive genuine, personalized videos directly from their favorite creators.

## How to Use StarConnect

**For Creators:** To become a part of the StarConnect ecosystem, creators need to connect their wallet and subscribe to the application and provide their name along with their desired price in Ether.

Additionally, they must share their unique identification (ID) with their audience to enable fans to connect with them seamlessly.

Once a fan purchases an NFT, the creator's journey begins. The creator records a video message according to the fan's request, uploads it to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and obtains the video's link.

Subsequently, they compile a JSON file with vital information (see below), including the video's IPFS link, they upload this file on IPFS and take the link to this JSON file.

Then they can proceed to mint the NFT, supplying the id of the request and the link to the NFT metadata.

This minting process is essential as it specifies the video's address, ensuring its authenticity and preventing potential alterations or manipulations.

Here's an example of the JSON file:

```solidity
{
  "name": "StarConnect",
  "description": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/video_cid?filename=name_of_the_video.mp4",
  "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWMBQjYUQXB9SiKUev31uwmjAY5R6Px2a1WBQvspS28a5?filename=logo-starconnec.jpg"
}
```

Moreover, creators can track and view the IDs of all the requests they receive, enabling them to efficiently manage their content creation process.

**For Fans:** Fans eager to engage with their favorite creators on StarConnect first need to obtain the creator's unique ID. It is crucial to ensure there are no spelling errors in the ID to avoid any discrepancies.

Once they have confirmed the creator's ID, fans can view the price in Ether set by the creator for personalized content.

To purchase an NFT and initiate the content creation process, fans transfer the specified amount of Ether to the creator's ID. In return, they receive a request ID, which acts as a reference for tracking the status of their request.

This transaction is carried out seamlessly on the blockchain, guaranteeing the security and transparency of the process.

While awaiting the minting of their personalized NFT, fans can stay updated on the progress.

Once the NFT has been successfully minted by the creator, fans can add it to their digital wallets, with the request ID serving as the unique identifier for their personalized content. This ensures that fans can cherish and share their exclusive content securely.

In the unfortunate event that a creator is unable to fulfill a fan's NFT request, perhaps due to unforeseen circumstances, fans have the option to request a refund by specifying the request ID. This safety net ensures that fans are not left disappointed, reinforcing the trust and reliability of the StarConnect platform.

## **Framework Used:**

The smart contracts powering StarConnect are built using the [Foundry framework](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), as its compilation speed and native fuzzing capabilities make it the best choice for creating a secure and developer-friendly environment.

To make the frontend robust and fast we chose React and React-router to manage the routes of the pages. Node.js was used as a backend runtime for JavaScript, and we took advantage of etherjs to connect the frontend and blockend. Last, Speheron was used for the Deployment of the dApp.
