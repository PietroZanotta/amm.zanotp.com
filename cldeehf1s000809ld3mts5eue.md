Hello world, and welcome to this blog. This article is just an introduction to www.zanotp.com, but first let me introduce myself: my name is Pietro Zanotta and currently I am an economics student in Switzerland (to read more see [here](https://www.zanotp.com/about)). My main interests are programming and statistics and this blog is my chance to tell the world what I'm learning in my free time.

Let me take a step back and explain why I decided to start this journey in blogging. In January 2023 I wrote an article about web scraping in R (you find it [here](https://statsandr.com/blog/web-scraping-in-r/)) and I discovered how useful is to share knowledge to deeply understand a topic. In fact not only it requires a deep comprehension of the topic but also great summary skills. Therefore, I decided to create my own blog and here we are.

Thanks for reading.

For any question or suggestion related to what I covered in this article, please add it as a comment.
